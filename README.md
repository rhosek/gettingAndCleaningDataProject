File: README.md

The contents of this repository represent the deliverables required to complete the class project for the 'Getting and Cleaning Data' Coursera Course. Starting with the raw data from an experiment designed to collect smartphone accerometer data from 30 individuals under different conditions, the purpose of this project is to extract and clean a subset of the data and transform it into a tidy dataset.
 
In addition to this 'README.md' file, which provides an overview of the entire project, this repository contains the following files:

run_analysis.R -- the primary script for creating the primary tidy dataset
CodeBook.md -- describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data
tidy_final.txt = primaryTidyDataSet
meansBySubjectAndActivity.txt = dataset of means
meansBySubjectAndActivity.R = script for creating dataset of means

We will assume that the data files are in the working directory and that packages plyr and dplyr are available.
